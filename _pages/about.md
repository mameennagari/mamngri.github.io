Hi, I am a researcher focused on privacy-preserving distributed machine learning, with particular expertise in Federated Learning, Federated Unlearning, and Semantic Communication. I obtained my *Master of Science in Computer Science and Technology* from [Dalian University of Technology, China](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), where my research focused on federated learning and unlearning. My work has been published in leading journals and conferences, including *IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing*, *Neural Networks*, *IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing*, and *IEEE/ACM IWQoS*. I have received multiple academic distinctions, including the **Outstanding Master’s Thesis Award** and **Outstanding Graduate Award**, and I actively serve as a reviewer for top-tier IEEE, Elsevier, and ACM venues.  

I am currently seeking a **PhD research position** to further advance research on **trustworthy, privacy-preserving, and federated semantic communication**, with the long-term goal of contributing impactful theoretical and applied research to next-generation intelligent and distributed computing infrastructures.
